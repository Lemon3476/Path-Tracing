## Features:
•	Implemented path tracing and performed per-pixel shading based on the calculation of direct and indirect lighting.  
•	Developed a sampling method and probability density function for the realistic rendering of diffuse materials.  
•	Created a bounding box for each object to accelerate ray-object intersection calculations.  
•	Divided the screen space into different parts and utilized multithreading on these parts to enhance rendering speed.  

## Notes:
I ran this code in the Linux system.  
It Is implemented for learning purposes.
